## Hi! I'm Alex.
Welcome to my attempt at documenting what I do and why I do it.

### A bit about me
I'm a technical person who sometimes gets very opinionated on subjects that I've spent a lot of time getting into. I learn a lot every month of my life, and in order to see that I was wrong at some stuff, I need a blog.

My day job is a software engineer, which is a fancy way of saying that I'm good at telling computers what to do really well and quite fast. Being ~~a software engineer~~ **a programmer** is a major part of my identity. I do it as a passion, and I've been doing it for longer than not doing it. But it's not my only passion. In fact, I'm very interested by the following things:

* Structural engineering
* Biology
* Physics
* Psychology
* Sociology
* Economics
* Making lists
* Maths
* Exploring the evolutions of positive feedback loops
* Sci-fi
* Understanding music
* History
* Philosophy
* Getting people bored
* Travel and food

... and a bunch of other stuff.

Many of them aren't just things that I find fascinating. I've actually read a few good books - enough to make people leave conversations when I start with "actually..." (I try to do that less now).

So, I will probably be writing mostly about boring software projects, maybe some rants here and there, praise and critique of books, music, or critique of critique of music. Maybe I should just go on Facebook? Naah, that's too public. Here at least nobody reads all this.
