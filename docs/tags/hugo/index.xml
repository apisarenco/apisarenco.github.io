      <description>I started off my career in data with relational databases. 18 years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve read 10 pages on how to use Microsoft Access, and my eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, as I was imagining how most of the problems that I, as a &amp;ldquo;techy boy&amp;rdquo; encountered at different people who were using mostly Excel for things that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t designed to do.
This quickly turned into a 3-month project, where I, an 18 year old teenager, replaced one of the most labour-intensive and error-prone data entry tasks in Excel, with a new MS Access database + front-end and reporting.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw the github pages of &lt;a href=&#34;https://conorcorp.github.io&#34;&gt;Conor Lamb&lt;/a&gt; and he had a nice guide there highlighting the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; steps in setting up a &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;not outdated&amp;rdquo; type of &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;. Jokes aside, there&amp;rsquo;s a reason why I decided to do it as well. Thanks Conor Lamb for the guide. It kinda helped! üëç&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Welcome to my attempt at documenting what I do and why I do it.
A bit about me I&amp;rsquo;m a technical person who sometimes gets very opinionated on subjects that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time getting into. I learn a lot every month of my life, and in order to see that I was wrong at some stuff, I need a blog.
My day job is a software engineer, which is a fancy way of saying that I&amp;rsquo;m good at telling computers what to do really well and quite fast.</description>
