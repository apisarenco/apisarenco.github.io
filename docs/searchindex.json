Hugo is a static website generator that takes a theme, a list of markdown files, and some config and static content and makes it kiss and make a baby which is this site you\u0026rsquo;re reading now.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s github pages Ever seen one of those \u0026ldquo;something.github.io\u0026rdquo; websites? Well, apparently, if you:\n Create a repository in your github account titled \u0026lt;your account id\u0026gt;.github.io Go to repository settings and configure github pages for this repository Slap some files in it BAM!  There is a build pipeline happening, and the contents of your repository get displayed as a website.\nPicking a theme This small step was actually harder than it sounds. A theme is what people see first, so it has to be:\n Easy to read. There are plenty of aggressive themes with hard to read fonts or too high contrast. Tuned for my use case. If I\u0026rsquo;m gonna write anything, it\u0026rsquo;s going to involve code, diagrams, maybe charts. Uncluttered. The last thing I need is extra large bars at the top of code blocks that seem like code. Pretty. While the appeal of themes like Anubis according to the rest of the criteria is hard to resist, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to appear human to you. For that, I needed you to see my friendly picture, so that you know that behind the image of a nerd there\u0026rsquo;s a smiling person. It \u0026hellip; has to work. My first attempt was a disaster. Pretty theme, but didn\u0026rsquo;t work with github pages, after a lot of headaches. Sad, but it\u0026rsquo;s more about the content, right? And I have none yet. The theme is less important. License. Almost forgot about that one. I want my content to be of a permissive license. Some of the themes I looked at were GPL family, and I\u0026rsquo;m no laywer, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get involved with having to have license issues as I use MIT, BSD, CC or WTFPL.  I could\u0026rsquo;ve also made my own. Although I am already in my pyjamas.\n","id":0,"section":"posts","summary":"I saw the github pages of Conor Lamb and he had a nice guide there highlighting the \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; steps in setting up a \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;not outdated\u0026rdquo; type of \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;.
