      <description>I saw the github pages of Conor Lamb and he had a nice guide there highlighting the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; steps in setting up a &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;not outdated&amp;rdquo; type of &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;. Jokes aside, there&amp;rsquo;s a reason why I decided to do it as well. Thanks Conor Lamb for the guide. It kinda helped! üëç

      <description>Welcome to my attempt at documenting what I do and why I do it.
A bit about me I&amp;rsquo;m a technical person who sometimes gets very opinionated on subjects that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time getting into. I learn a lot every month of my life, and in order to see that I was wrong at some stuff, I need a blog.
My day job is a software engineer, which is a fancy way of saying that I&amp;rsquo;m good at telling computers what to do really well and quite fast.</description>
