      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Alex. Welcome to my attempt at documenting what I do and why I do it.
A bit about me I&amp;rsquo;m a technical person who sometimes gets very opinionated on subjects that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time getting into. I learn a lot every month of my life, and in order to see that I was wrong at some stuff, I need a blog.
My day job is a software engineer, which is a fancy way of saying that I&amp;rsquo;m good at telling computers what to do really well and quite fast.</description>
